# Experimental DAW — scope and implementation ledger

The objective is a broad Logic-style workstation with an agent that can operate
all its basic editing features. This ledger preserves that scope across iterations.
It is not a declaration of Logic Pro feature parity.

## Research (2026-09-18)

Apple describes Logic Pro as a DAW, including track arrangement, recording,
region editing, piano-roll/score/event editors, MIDI controllers, software
instruments, effects, automation, mixing, bouncing, and video synchronization.
Its guide also covers comping, take folders, track stacks, tempo/signature maps,
Live Loops, step sequencing, audio warping/pitch editing, surround/spatial audio,
external hardware, and project interchange.

We implement original Cuestamp code and controls. Apple instruments, proprietary
plug-ins, bundled sound libraries, and native Logic project formats require
separate compatible implementations or licensed integrations.

## Architecture

All edits are serializable commands applied to a validated session document.
Manual controls and model actions use the same command executor. A batch is atomic;
an invalid operation must leave the session unchanged. The audio renderer consumes
the same document used by the arrangement. Model requests must never expose server
credentials and must not execute arbitrary JavaScript or shell commands.

Maintain real capability status in the UI. Unimplemented DSP, plug-ins, and AI
connections must not masquerade as functioning controls. The scope remains open
until all capability groups have authoritative implementation and verification.


## Verified checkpoint — 2026-09-18

- `test/experimental-session.test.js`: atomic rollback, undo/redo, stale revisions,
  MIDI splits, SMF note round trip, tempo changes, model-output validation.
- `scripts/browser-experimental-check.cjs`: Experimental route, note placement,
  undo/redo, mock-model edit, playback clock, actual OfflineAudioContext PCM render,
  WAV download and local reload.
- Entire repository: 126 tests passing; Vite production build passing.
- Not verified: actual model inference, microphone/MIDI hardware, production DAW save,
  heavy sessions, mobile editing.

Current limitations are substantive: simple oscillator instruments, no automation recording,
overdub/comping, professional time stretching/pitch editing,
notation, SysEx and full MIDI metadata preservation, Live Loops, or spatial audio. Browser source
decoding currently caps individual audio at 250 MB; offline bounce caps ten minutes.
Movie audio can be extracted to a separate track and mixed when the browser supports its codec. Session JSON references device-local assets. Export project bundles original media
in a portable archive; account save/reopen now uses the existing project and media services. The full goal remains active.

Next implementation priorities: MIDI event/device tools; recording; master metering; crossfades; movie render/export; connected model validation.

## Mixer and rendering checkpoint

`test/experimental-effects.test.js` covers insert validation/reordering/bypass,
automation upserts, interpolation, bounds, undo, and tail duration.
`scripts/browser-experimental-effects-check.cjs` exercises effect controls,
automation parameter persistence and aligned stem ZIP downloads. Actual browser
OfflineAudioContext samples verify low-pass attenuation, compression, echo decay,
reverb tails, volume/pan automation and seeking into a curve.

Track inserts precede gain and pan. Volume automation interpolates in dB; pan
interpolates linearly. Edits currently stop transport. Seeking initializes curves
but does not preroll previous reverb/delay history. Stem exports exclude muted and
video tracks, ignore solo, and include each track's inserts, automation and master
gain. All files share the full arrangement length plus effect tails. They are
WAVs with selectable 16/24-bit PCM or 32-bit float and 44.1/48/96 kHz sample rates; grouped-bus export remains pending. ZIP
creation holds rendered stems in memory, so large sessions need further work.

## Portable project checkpoint

Export project creates a `.cuestamp.zip` with the validated session, original audio
and video, and file metadata. Shared sources are bundled once. Import assigns fresh
asset IDs and stores all files in one IndexedDB transaction before switching the
session. Missing files and invalid edits reject import/export. Archives support
512 MB total media and a 10 MB manifest; extraction enforces decompressed limits.
Archive creation remains memory-based. JSON-only export remains available.

`test/experimental-archive.test.js` checks byte preservation, shared references,
effect/edit persistence, ID isolation, missing sources and malformed manifests.
`scripts/browser-experimental-archive-check.cjs` tests export followed by clearing
local storage and IndexedDB, import, playback and reload.

## Piano-roll editing checkpoint

Notes support selection, pitch/start/length/velocity fields, drag movement in
configurable musical increments, right-edge resizing, duplicate and explicit deletion.
The inspector displays beats while shared commands store seconds. The selected
note ID is passed to the agent. Invalid edits leave the prior document unchanged.
The browser piano regression covers drag pitch/time, resize, selection without
deletion, duplicate/delete/undo, edit rejection, region inspector and reload.
Variable snap grids are implemented. Multiple-note selection and graphical MIDI CC lanes remain pending.

## Region editing checkpoint

Audio/video edge handles trim the timeline and original-source offset together.
Reverse audio trimming adjusts the opposite source boundary. Trim adjusts fades
to fit the resulting duration and never changes original media. Audio/MIDI fade
handles display an envelope and prevent overlapping fades. Movement snaps to
sixteenth-note increments; holding Shift during dragging allows unsnapped edits.
The numeric inspector remains available for exact values. Source extension through
handles is bounded by decoded source duration; without decoded metadata it stays
within the known source range. The shared `region.trim` command is agent-accessible.

Unit tests cover forward/reverse source alignment, undo, fade limits and invalid
boundaries. The browser region check exercises both trim edges and fade handles,
undo/redo, playback and persisted restoration. Dedicated crossfades, MIDI-region
trimming and keyboard-accessible handles remain pending.

## Microphone recording checkpoint

Record audio requests microphone permission only after a click and captures PCM
through AudioWorklet. Stop recording saves a new original WAV and audio track at
the starting playhead position. The format is 16-bit PCM at the browser context
sample rate, up to two channels and ten minutes per take. This is not a float/24-bit
recording path. Input gain processing, noise suppression and echo cancellation
are requested off; device drivers may still apply their own processing.

Recording is standalone: transport stops and editor controls lock during capture.
The input meter and elapsed time update without repainting the editor. Cancel or
leaving Experimental discards the active take and releases the microphone; the UI
states this. Existing saved takes remain intact. Failure to persist a finalized
take downloads its WAV as a recovery copy. Sources remain device-local until exported.

Unit tests verify variable block sizes, stereo order and final-frame flushing.
The browser recording check uses Chromium's synthetic microphone, verifies nonzero
PCM, timeline placement, persistence, cancellation and navigation cleanup. Physical
hardware, device selection, monitoring and latency calibration are not verified.

## Bus routing checkpoint

+ Bus creates a mixer channel that receives track outputs and selectable pre-fader,
post-fader or post-pan sends. Bus channels support the existing insert effects and volume/pan automation.
Outputs can route through nested buses; the command executor rejects nonexistent
destinations and feedback cycles. Deleting a bus returns its upstream outputs to
Master and removes sends to it, with undo restoring the routing.

Bus solo includes its upstream sources, including their other output paths. This
is source auditioning, not isolated bus-return solo. Explicit grouped-bus export
remains pending. Send-level automation is now implemented. Per-track stem rendering
keeps the bus graph, effects and tails. Shared nonlinear bus effects (such as
compression) process each isolated stem differently from the combined full mix,
so summing those stems need not reproduce the mix exactly.

Unit tests cover cycle rejection, references/deletion/undo, bus solo, tails and
stem routing. The browser routing check exercises output/send controls and actual
PCM bus gain, summed sends, mute and isolated-stem signal paths. The effects browser
regression continues to verify EQ/dynamics/delay/reverb/automation and ZIP export.

## MIDI channel-event checkpoint

SMF import/export preserves note channels and track names, plus control change,
pitch bend, program change, channel pressure and polyphonic pressure events.
Controller-only tracks survive import. The MIDI event editor adds/updates/deletes
events by beat, channel, type, controller/note number and value. These operations
share undo and agent commands. Notes also expose their channel in the inspector.
Tempo edits rescale events with MIDI notes; splits chase earlier controller state
into the right segment, and duplication gives events fresh IDs.

Synth playback supports CC7 volume, CC11 expression, CC10 pan, CC64 sustain and
fixed ±2-semitone pitch bend independently by channel, including seek initialization.
Program/pressure events and other controllers are stored/exported but do not change
the built-in oscillator instrument. RPN bend-range changes, SysEx, full metadata,
tempo-map interchange, MIDI hardware, and per-channel instrument assignment remain
pending. MIDI export omits zero-velocity silent notes rather than making them audible.

Unit tests verify typed event round trips, channel identity, controller-only tracks,
validation, tempo scaling and split state. The browser MIDI-event check exercises
the event form, export and undo, plus actual PCM volume, sustained notes and pitch
bend. Note-edit and effects regressions cover the shared renderer and editor.

## Scoring-to-picture checkpoint

Video monitor controls support 23.976/24/25/29.97/30/50/59.94/60 fps, non-drop
HH:MM:SS:FF, direct timecode seeking and one-frame stepping. Fractional rates use
exact 1000/1001 timing. Non-drop labels intentionally drift from wall-clock time
at fractional rates; drop-frame numbering and embedded source timecode are pending.
Frame stepping seeks the HTML video element, not a frame-indexed native decoder.

Extract movie audio creates a separate audio track referencing the same original
asset and preserving its start, offset and duration. The browser must decode the
movie's audio codec and the existing 250 MB decode limit applies. Subsequent edits
to the extracted track are independent from picture. Agent commands can extract
audio and set the project frame rate. Rendering a movie with replacement audio
and automatic linked edits between picture and extracted sound remain pending.

Unit tests cover integer/fractional timecode, bounds and extraction/undo. The
browser video check generates a real MP4 with AAC audio and checks offset seeking,
frame navigation, shared source identity, audible WAV bounce and picture/transport
synchronization. This does not establish frame-accurate sync across every codec
or long movies.

## Drum composition checkpoint

+ Drum track adds a MIDI track with an original synthesized kit. Add a MIDI region
to edit kick, snare, closed/open hat, crash and ride hits on a bar-based sixteenth
grid. The grid follows project meter and tempo; hits use ordinary channel-10 MIDI
notes and are editable in the piano roll and through agent note commands. Velocity,
bar selection and undo are supported. No recorded sample library or model generation
is involved. Other pitches currently use a generic metallic percussion voice.

The shared playback/offline engine renders deterministic PCM drum voices, honoring
velocity, channel controllers, region fades, routing and effects. Percussion decays
continue past MIDI note-off but stop at the region boundary. Pitch bend and sustain
do not change drum voices. Sample-kit loading, per-drum sound controls, swing,
probability, polymeters and pattern variations remain pending.

Unit tests verify deterministic distinct voices and percussion-channel MIDI export.
The browser drum check covers hit toggles, bar navigation, velocity, undo, exported
notes and actual PCM output at the expected pattern positions.

## Cycle transport checkpoint

Cycle stores an enabled flag and start/end seconds in the session. Use selected
region copies its boundaries; the agent can edit these session fields. Playback
renders the range (up to ten minutes) once and repeats an AudioBufferSourceNode
loop. Transport position and video synchronization follow the wrapped audio clock.
Pause resumes within the range; Stop resets the playhead. Offline rendering begins
at sample zero, avoiding the normal live scheduler's startup padding in every cycle.

This implementation repeats the rendered slice. Effect tails and synth state reset
at the boundary, and a discontinuity at the chosen cut can click. There is no
cross-boundary DSP preroll or automatic loop crossfade yet. Editing stops playback;
full-session exports ignore Cycle. Microphone takes remain standalone recordings.

Unit tests check wrapping and atomic/undoable range updates. The cycle browser
check verifies repeated wraps, pause, persistence, exact PCM range length without
startup padding, and canceling a pending cycle render with Stop.

## Account DAW project checkpoint

DAW projects use `type: daw` in the existing Projects JSON record. Neon stores the
validated arrangement and a local-source-ID to owned Blob-asset-ID map. The existing
private reserve/upload/complete path stores original files. No migration or new
service credential is required. All referenced assets must be ready, owned by the
user, and audio/video; missing/extra mappings and invalid document invariants reject
save. Project revisions prevent stale overwrites and project types cannot change.
Document IDs are restricted to safe alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen identifiers.

Save to account and Save a copy appear for signed-in users. Completed uploads are
reused after finalization/save failures. Projects has an Experimental DAW filter
and opens these records in Experimental. Restoration downloads originals, checks
byte lengths, stores them in an IndexedDB transaction and assigns fresh local IDs.
The current session is replaced only after downloads complete. Unsaved-session
replacement asks through an app dialog and keeps a local JSON backup. New session
starts a separate arrangement. Media remains shared when saving a copy.

The API's existing 1 MB JSON body limit applies; portable export remains available
for larger documents. Uploads currently use original files rather than the audio
library's lossless upload preprocessing. Cloud save is explicit, not automatic.
Version history beyond optimistic revision checks, cloud media cleanup, and a
user-facing local-backup recovery browser remain pending.

PGlite tests cover source ownership/readiness, map validation, stale revisions and
read isolation. The browser account check mocks API/Blob interactions and verifies
save/copy/conflict, Projects opening, and retry without duplicate uploads. The live development Neon/Blob round trip now passes; production and real WorkOS
authentication were not exercised by that check.

## Live account storage verification

`scripts/daw-live-smoke.mjs` passes against the documented development Neon branch
and configured private Blob store. It drives the browser's real multipart upload,
token/completion handler and signed source download, while using a temporary test
identity instead of WorkOS. Project requests exercise the real repository through
a test transport adapter. After clearing localStorage/IndexedDB, reopening from
Projects restores the exact original bytes and plays the audio. A subsequent save
increments the project revision without creating another media asset.

The first run exposed an unapplied existing folder migration on the development
branch. The branch was confirmed through `current_setting('neon.branch_id', true)`
against CODEX.md, and the repository migrations were applied. The smoke script now
checks that exact development branch and folder schema before creating fixtures.
Both test runs cleaned up their synthetic Blob objects and database records.
This verifies development storage integration, not production deployment or a real
WorkOS sign-in.

## WAV export quality checkpoint

Export settings apply to stereo mixes and each per-track stem: 44.1, 48 or 96 kHz,
16/24-bit PCM or 32-bit float. Defaults stay 44.1 kHz / 16-bit for compatibility.
Integer exports clip at full scale; float retains over-range samples for later
mixing. No normalization or dither is applied. Settings are workspace controls,
not edits to the arrangement and are not persisted with the document yet.
Offline bounce starts at time zero without the live transport's 25 ms scheduling
padding. All stems still share the arrangement length including effect tails.

WAV unit tests verify signed 24-bit packing, interleaving, RIFF padding, headers,
float headroom and the default recording format. The browser bounce check verifies
actual mix/stem downloads, sample rates, start timing and browser float decoding.

## MIDI timing and feel checkpoint

The piano roll includes a Timing & feel panel. Quantize offers straight and triplet
grids, 0–100% strength and 0–75% swing delay. Swing delays alternate grid points by
that fraction of the chosen grid interval; it is not a conventional swing-ratio
percentage. Starts move toward the nearest swung point and are clamped to keep
whole notes inside the region. Existing grid-only commands retain full straight
quantization behavior, with safer region boundaries.

Humanize varies note starts and lengths by a configurable number of milliseconds
and velocity by MIDI steps. The variation seed makes the edit deterministic across
server validation and browser application, independent of note order. Zero-valued
parameters leave that property unchanged; silent notes stay silent. Pitch and
channel are preserved. Both tools apply to all notes in the region or one selected
note, through the same atomic, undoable commands used by the agent. Reapplying
humanization compounds changes; undo first to compare different seeds from the
same starting notes. Tool preferences last for the current workspace instance;
resulting note edits persist in projects and MIDI exports.

`notes.quantize` adds optional strength, swing and noteId. `notes.humanize` accepts
seed, timing/duration in seconds, velocity in 0–1 units and optional noteId. Agent
instructions document these units and semantics. Mocked agent tests validate the
same deterministic output; a real connected model remains unverified.

Tests cover region edges, selected-note scope, deterministic/order-independent
variation, input rejection, atomic rollback, undo/redo, browser controls, session
restoration and downloaded MIDI timing/velocity. Multi-note selection, hardware
MIDI recording, groove templates and non-destructive region quantize parameters
remain pending.

## Master effects checkpoint

The mixer exposes Master effects using the same ordered EQ, compressor, delay and
reverb controls as track/bus inserts. The signal path is summed tracks/buses →
master inserts → master volume → output. Effects support add, edit, bypass, move,
delete and undo. `effect.add` targets the session ID for a master insert; existing
set/move/delete commands target its effect ID. Agent instructions document this
path, and globally unique IDs and the 16-effect chain limit apply to master inserts.

Sessions store `masterEffects`, defaulting to an empty chain for older projects.
The shared renderer applies these inserts in transport, cycle and offline WAV
rendering; arrangement duration includes their tails. Per-track stems include the
master chain, processed separately for each exported track, so nonlinear processing
can prevent their sum from reproducing the complete mix. Cycle effects still reset
at each loop boundary. Master metering, limiting, and export
options to omit master processing remain pending.

137 unit tests and the build pass. The master browser check verifies controls,
reorder/bypass/removal/undo, persistence, real PCM filtering/compression and bypass,
cancellation of opposite signals before master processing, post-effect master
gain, and rendered reverb tails. Existing track effects/automation/stem checks pass.

## Master automation checkpoint

Master channel now has the shared volume/pan automation editor and a static master
pan control. `session.set` accepts masterPan (-1..1); automation.point/clear target
the session ID for master curves, while automation.delete still targets a point ID.
Master curves run after master inserts, override masterDb/masterPan and interpolate
in the same way as track curves. Seeking initializes the value at the requested
position. Playback, cycle rendering and offline exports use the same scheduler.
Master processing is also retained in per-track stems.

The document stores masterAutomation and masterPan; older sessions default to no
points and centered pan. Commands enforce global ID uniqueness, parameter bounds,
atomic rollback and undo. Clearing one master curve preserves the other parameter
and all track automation. This edits curves explicitly; live automation recording
and master metering remain pending.

140 unit tests and the build pass. Browser checks exercise master curve controls,
clear/undo, static pan and persistence, and measure actual PCM fade levels, hard-pan
channel isolation, seek equivalence and effects followed by master gain. The
existing track-effects/automation/export regression also passes. Agent fade plans
are tested with a mocked provider; real inference remains unverified.

## Send position checkpoint

Each send now has a Position selector: Before volume (`preFader`), After volume
(`postFader`), or After pan (`postPan`). All three taps are after the channel inserts.
Before volume ignores the source volume and pan curves; After volume follows volume
but ignores pan; After pan follows both. Send gain then scales that tapped signal
before it enters the destination bus. Source and bus mute silence every outgoing
send, including pre-fader sends. Routing cycle validation is unchanged.

`send.set` accepts optional tap and can update an existing send's level or position
independently. New sends require a level. Older projects default to postPan,
preserving their previous mix. Commands are atomic and undoable; positions persist
in projects and share the playback/offline/stem renderer. Agent instructions describe
these positions and mute semantics. Send-level automation is implemented in the
following checkpoint.

141 unit tests and the build pass. The send-position browser check verifies controls,
undo and persistence plus actual PCM fader/pan independence, volume automation,
post-insert filtering and mute for sources and nested buses. The existing bus routing
and stem check also passes.

## Send automation checkpoint

Each send has an expandable automation panel using the same curve editor as tracks
and the master. Its gain points interpolate in dB, override the static send level,
and use absolute session seconds. Curves work with every send position and remain
independent of source volume/pan automation. Clearing the curve restores the static
send gain; deleting the send or destination bus removes its curve, with undo
restoring it. Open send panels remain open while editing during the current view.

`send.automation.point` targets the source track with busId, optional point id, time
and value (-96..12 dB). It upserts points at the same time. `send.automation.clear`
targets the source with busId, and `automation.delete` removes any automation point
by its globally unique ID. Send schemas default old projects to empty curves and
permit up to 2,000 gain points per send. Pan curves are not accepted on sends.
Agent tool instructions expose these commands and units.

143 unit tests and the build pass. Browser checks verify send-editor isolation,
point/clear/undo, persistence and actual rendered send fades, seek restoration,
stem equivalence and mute. Existing track/master curve and effect tests pass after
extracting the common editor. Live automation recording and effect-parameter automation remain pending;
draggable curve handles are now implemented.

## Direct automation editing checkpoint

Track, master and send curve points can be dragged, edited numerically, or adjusted
from a focused graph handle with arrow keys. Left/right moves by 0.1 seconds;
up/down changes gain by 0.5 dB or pan by 0.05. Shift multiplies those steps by ten.
Delete/Backspace removes the focused point. Focus survives repeated keyboard edits.
Dragging previews the curve and time/value, then commits one undoable edit on
release; pointer cancellation restores the original display. Handles stay inside
the graph edges, and gain graphs show the full supported -96..12 dB range.

`automation.set` targets an existing point ID with optional time/value and works
across tracks, master and sends. It preserves ID and parameter, rejects out-of-range
values and same-parameter time collisions, and shares atomic execution and undo
with agent edits. Different parameters can occupy the same time. Numeric editing
allows precise values beyond the current graph's horizontal range.

145 unit tests and the build pass. Browser tests verify dragging without duplicate
points, repeated keyboard edits/focus, deletion/undo, numeric updates, collision
rollback, send isolation and persisted changes. Track/master/send PCM regression
checks also pass. Multi-point selection, curved interpolation and live automation
recording remain pending.

## Atomic MIDI import checkpoint

The previous importer issued batches of note/event edits and then combined history
entries afterward. Large files could evict older undo entries, and failed imports
replaced the history object, losing existing undo/redo. MIDI file import now uses a
single `midi.import` command: decode/parse/validate the entire file, construct its
tracks and regions, then commit once. Failures leave the session and history
unchanged. A successful import increments the revision once, and undo removes the
whole imported file. Existing imports use fresh IDs, so the same file can be
imported more than once. Import stops transport before applying changes.

The command accepts original SMF data as base64 and optional start in session
seconds. Limits are 8 MB per MIDI file, 128 total session tracks, and 20,000 notes
plus 20,000 channel events per imported track. Existing time/duration bounds still
apply. Long track names are capped at the document's 200-character limit. Files
with no supported notes/channel events reject rather than creating empty history.
Times retain the parser's tempo-map conversion to seconds; tempo-map round-trip,
SysEx and unsupported metadata remain pending. Agent instructions prohibit
fabricating MIDI payloads; normal UI uploads invoke the same validated command.

148 unit tests and the build pass. The browser check imports 10,001 notes and 250
controller events, verifies single-step undo/redo, failed-import preservation,
export counts and reload. This run completed the import in 247 ms on the local test
machine; that is one measured fixture, not a general performance guarantee. Unit
tests also verify retention of 99 earlier undo entries and rejection of oversized
note lists. Large-session real-time playback and piano-roll rendering still need
separate performance work.

## Piano-roll snap checkpoint

Piano roll Snap offers Off, quarter/eighth/sixteenth/thirty-second notes, and eighth/
sixteenth triplets. Grid lines and note placement follow the selected interval at
the current tempo. Dragging moves/resizes in grid increments while preserving an
existing timing offset; Quantize aligns starts to exact grid positions. Holding
Shift temporarily bypasses snapping for placement, movement or resize. Off uses
free positioning and a default sixteenth-note insertion length. Region boundaries
and MIDI pitch/length limits still apply.

Snap is a workspace UI preference, retained through edits but reset to 1/16 on
reload. It is independent of the Quantize grid. The resulting note.add/note.set
edits use the existing shared command harness, undo and persistence; agent commands
remain precise seconds and are not constrained by a mouse-editing preference.

150 unit tests and the build pass. Browser checks verify triplet insertion,
relative-grid dragging, free movement/resize, Shift bypass, undo/redo, tempo-aware
grid width and saved notes. Existing inspector, duplicate/delete, drag/resize and
selected-note agent-context regression checks also pass.

## MIDI input recording checkpoint

Experimental has Connect MIDI, device selection, Record MIDI, Stop & save MIDI and
Discard take controls. Permission is requested only from Connect, with sysex:false.
The Web MIDI integration follows the [W3C Web MIDI API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/)
for input enumeration, event timestamps and device state changes. Unsupported or
denied access produces an in-app message; importing MIDI files remains available.

This records a standalone take from one input at the current playhead. Notes retain
channels and velocities; controller, bend, program and pressure messages are kept.
Repeated same-pitch notes are paired per channel; held notes close at Stop. MIDI
clock/SysEx messages are ignored. Capture is limited to ten minutes, 20,000 notes
and 20,000 channel events. Reaching a limit or disconnecting the device stops and
saves captured material. No live instrument monitoring, overdub, metronome/count-in,
MIDI output or latency calibration is implemented yet.

The take goes through the shared atomic MIDI import command into a new editable
track and can be undone as one action. It is converted through the existing
480-PPQ MIDI writer/parser, so timing has that tick resolution. Storage failures
restore the prior session/history and keep the take for retry; edits stay locked
until saved or discarded. Explicit cancellation or leaving Experimental discards
an unsaved take and closes input listeners. Pending device opens are invalidated
on navigation. Device permission/recording is an explicit UI action; the agent can
edit the resulting document through the existing harness.

153 unit tests and the build pass. A simulated Web MIDI browser test checks access
options, capture/import/undo, cancellation, disconnect recovery, save retry,
permission denial and navigation during a pending input open. Capture unit tests
cover note pairing, channels, controllers, invalid messages and limits. Existing
synthetic microphone recording tests also pass. No physical MIDI keyboard, device
driver latency or browser/OS compatibility matrix was tested.

## Grouped stem export checkpoint

Export settings now selects individual-track stems or output groups. Sources sharing
the same final primary output bus render together through that bus's processing.
Nested groups roll into the outermost output bus; Master-routed sources remain
individual files. This partitions unmuted audio/MIDI sources exactly once. Send-only
relationships never change membership. All buses remain in each render so that
source contributions retain downstream routes, sends, inserts and automation.
Solo is ignored; bus mute is preserved. Session data and undo history are unchanged.

The ZIP uses numbered, sanitized group names and identical full-arrangement lengths
including tails. Existing sample rate/bit depth selections apply. This is grouping
by output routing, not an isolated bus-output tap: shared return/master processing
still runs separately per group. Nonlinear processing shared across groups may
therefore prevent summed stems from matching the complete mix. Arbitrary export
selection, isolated bus taps and master-processing bypass remain pending.

155 unit tests and the build pass. Browser checks download real grouped WAVs and
verify file names, alignment and summed PCM against the full mix, including two
instruments compressed together inside a bus. Unit tests cover nested outputs,
send-only contributors, muted/video exclusion, solo clearing, routing validity and
unchanged source documents. Physical-device and production deployment validation
are outside this export checkpoint.

## MIDI region crop checkpoint

MIDI timeline regions now expose trim handles and a numeric Crop MIDI region form.
The shared `region.trim` command accepts absolute start/end boundaries inside the
current region. Notes are clipped and rebased without changing surviving IDs,
pitches, channels or velocities. Latest pre-cut controller/program/bend/pressure
state is chased to zero, unless an event for that state already exists at the cut.
Notes released before the cut but held by sustain are retained through their pedal
release. Fades are constrained to the remaining region. Undo restores the exact
original notes/events; invalid commands leave the document unchanged.

This is an event crop, not a non-destructive source-window model. Outward trim is
clamped and cannot restore cropped material; use Undo. Synth envelopes restart at
the new note onset, so a left crop does not preserve oscillator phase or the exact
waveform from the original note. Non-destructive hidden MIDI material and continuous
synthesis state across edits remain future work. No claim of full Logic parity.

157 unit tests pass. Browser verification covers edge dragging, numeric boundaries,
controller chase, undo/redo, reload, and actual offline audio before/inside/after
the crop. Audio/video source-based trimming remains on its existing code path.

## Playback metronome checkpoint

The playback metronome follows BPM and quarter-note beats per bar, accents beat one,
and offers an independent -60..0 dB level (default -18 dB, disabled by default).
It is modeled after the playback-click workflow described in Apple's
[metronome guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/use-the-metronome-lgcp0534986f/10.7/mac/11.0).
Our synthesized click is original. It bypasses the session mixer/effects and is
opted into playback only; default cycle rendering, mix/stem bounces and MIDI exports
exclude it. Changing settings uses the shared command harness and stops transport.

One generated bar is looped with a playback-rate correction for rounded buffer
length, keeping node/memory usage bounded without accumulating bar-length rounding
drift. Seek resumes at the bar-relative offset. Cycle playback renders click with
the selected range and repeats that range, including mid-bar boundaries. Stop,
pause and navigation release the click source through the transport lifecycle.

159 unit tests and the build pass. Browser checks verify accented beats, spacing,
level ratio, seek and cycle PCM, idempotent stop, UI undo/persistence, playback and
silence in an actual exported WAV with click enabled. Existing cycle regression
checks also pass. Count-in, recording click, denominator/meter changes over time,
subdivisions and configurable metronome output routing remain pending.

## Recording metronome checkpoint

A separate During recording checkbox enables click for audio/MIDI takes via the
shared `session.set` field `metronomeRecordEnabled`, default false. Playback click
remains independently configurable. Both share tempo, quarter-note beats per bar,
level and playhead-relative phase. Audio capture gates incoming samples at the same
scheduled frame used to start click. Output click does not enter the microphone
capture graph. MIDI capture prepares the audio context before opening the take;
late preparation is invalidated after cancellation/navigation. Finish, discard,
disconnect, duration limits and save-failure transitions stop the click.

160 unit tests and build pass. Worklet tests cover exact frame gating inside a
processing block and stereo flushing. Synthetic microphone tests cover audible
input, timeline placement, click cleanup, and a silent input saved with output
click active (saved PCM stays silent). Simulated MIDI tests cover click cleanup
on stop/cancel/disconnect, save retry, late device open and late audio resume.
Physical device latency, acoustic bleed, OS scheduling and browser support still
need hardware verification. Count-in, monitoring and overdub remain pending.

## Recording count-in checkpoint

Audio and MIDI recording now support zero, one or two bars of count-in using the
current BPM and quarter-note beats per bar. Pre-roll click is independent of the
During recording checkbox; that option controls click after recording begins.
Click phase follows the selected playhead, including mid-bar starts. The document
field `countInBars` defaults to zero and uses shared command validation/undo.

Audio capture gates on the scheduled post-count-in frame. MIDI capture ignores
messages timestamped before its calculated capture start, including pre-roll note
ons and controllers. Early input does not enter the saved take; held notes begun
before recording are not retriggered. MIDI performance timestamps are mapped to
the audio clock during preparation, without hardware-latency compensation. Save
is disabled during count-in, while Cancel/navigation release active input and click.
Ten-minute recording limits count the take, not pre-roll.

163 unit tests and build pass. New tests cover duration/frame rounding, MIDI pre-roll
exclusion and setting validation. Browser tests verify audio/MIDI count-in display,
early-save disabling, no pre-roll in saved material, placement, cancel cleanup,
persistence and PCM click stopping/continuation. Existing synthetic microphone and
MIDI lifecycle checks also pass. Physical devices, hardware latency and suspended
background-tab timing still require verification; overdub/monitoring remain open.

## Piano-roll multi-selection checkpoint

Ctrl/Cmd-click toggles notes; Select all notes and Clear selection complement it.
Selected notes move together by drag or relative beat/semitone fields. Dragging
clamps the whole group to time/pitch boundaries, preserving internal spacing and
intervals. Shift remains the temporary snap bypass. Right-edge resizing affects
only that note. Duplicate selection places copies after the selected span; Delete
selection removes the group. Timing & feel can target the selected group. The
existing region-wide transpose button is explicitly labeled as region-wide.

Bulk notes.move/delete/duplicate commands operate atomically on comma-separated
noteIds under a region. Missing, duplicate or out-of-region IDs fail without edits;
invalid resulting pitches/times and note limits fail full session validation. IDs
are preserved on move and regenerated on duplication. Bulk changes use one undo
entry even above the 100-command batch limit. Agent requests include selected note
IDs and reject stale/duplicate selections before contacting the provider. Existing
single-note selection remains in the request for compatibility.

168 unit tests and build pass. Tests include 1,001-note atomic movement/undo, group
transform scoping and mocked provider validation. Browser checks cover selection,
group dragging, relative edits, copy/delete/undo, agent context, timing scope and
saved edits. Existing single-note and timing/feel browser checks pass. Selection
is transient and not persisted; marquee selection, multi-region selection and group
resize remain pending. Real model inference remains unverified.

## Box selection and group length editing checkpoint

The piano-roll tool selector offers Draw notes (default) and Select notes. Dragging
empty grid space in Select mode draws a box; Alt-drag temporarily selects in Draw
mode. Intersecting note rectangles are selected, in either drag direction, using
coordinates that account for grid scrolling. Ctrl/Cmd/Shift adds to the existing
selection. Escape/pointer cancellation restores it. Selection does not change the
document or create undo history, and empty-space selection does not add notes.

Right-edge dragging now resizes the selected group by a shared duration delta,
clamped so every note remains positive and within the region and duration limits.
The relative Length change form offers exact beat entry. Both use one atomic
notes.resize command through the agent/manual harness; starts, pitches and internal
length differences are retained. Single-note resizing and Shift snap bypass remain.

170 unit tests and build pass. Tests cover visual intersection geometry, reverse
dragging, duration bounds and atomic undo. Browser checks exercise box selection,
additive selection, Escape cancellation, Alt override, group drag/numeric resizing,
undo/redo and ordinary Draw insertion. Existing piano inspector and snap regression
checks pass. Box auto-scroll, multi-region selection and proportional scaling remain
pending; this does not complete the broader DAW goal.

## Selected-region bounce checkpoint

Bounce region exports a selected audio or MIDI region through the existing track,
bus and master processing. The file begins at the region boundary; original source
offset/fades/reversal are kept, and automation initializes at the original session
time. Other regions are removed from the render document. Bus/master tails extend
the output; solo is ignored, while track and bus mute remain active. Video reference
regions must first have audio extracted. Sample rate/bit depth settings apply.

A shared bounce planner now clones the complete session before asynchronous work
for mix, stem and region exports. Settings, title, routing and render duration stay
fixed while the user edits. Only audible audio assets in that plan are decoded.
Region export can therefore succeed with an unrelated missing source and can export
a short region late in a long arrangement, subject to the ten-minute output limit.

172 unit tests and build pass. Real browser downloads verify selected-only audio,
source offset, delay onset/tail, master gain automation at region time, MIDI synthesis
and the captured filename while editing during rendering. Existing mix/grouped-stem
format and summed PCM checks pass. DSP state begins at the region boundary; preceding
regions and their effect history are intentionally absent, so this is not a slice
of the fully mixed arrangement. In-place rendering, arbitrary time-range export,
movie muxing and master-processing bypass remain pending.

## Recording with arrangement playback checkpoint

Play arrangement while recording is a persistent, undoable `recordWithPlayback`
setting, off by default. Audio/MIDI takes continue creating new tracks while the
existing arrangement plays through the shared routing/effects/automation renderer.
Only audible audio sources are prepared. A fixed document snapshot is captured
before decoding, and edits are locked during a take. The microphone capture graph
remains separate from accompaniment and click output. Count-in starts backing at
the capture boundary; MIDI maps performance timestamps to the audio clock without
hardware latency compensation. Clock/playhead and movie preview advance with the
recording progress. Stop/cancel/disconnect/navigation release backing playback.

173 unit tests and build pass. Browser checks cover actual audio/MIDI takes, new
track placement, transport advancement, cancel cleanup, saved settings, backing
PCM starting at the requested time with seeked gain automation, and a silent input
remaining silent while backing synthesis runs. Existing count-in and MIDI lifecycle
checks pass. Tests use synthetic devices. Video behavior is wired to the existing
monitor but synchronized recording against a real movie/hardware setup still needs
verification. Recording is linear even when Cycle is enabled. Live input audition,
recording into existing tracks, take lanes, loop recording, punch/comping and
calibrated latency remain pending.

### Live MIDI audition during recording

Hear MIDI while recording adds opt-in triangle synthesis during capture and count-in.
The persisted `midiMonitorEnabled` flag uses the shared validated `session.set`
command, so manual and agent edits support undo. Voices implement note release,
repeated-note FIFO pairing, channel-specific sustain, volume/expression/pan and
fixed ±2-semitone pitch bend. All sound off, all notes off and reset controllers
handle live voices. Audition is bounded to 64 simultaneous voices and bypasses the
mixer; stop, cancel, disconnect and navigation dispose the monitor. Count-in notes
are heard but are excluded from the saved take. Saved controller playback retains
the existing renderer's supported subset; this is not a full General MIDI synth.

174 unit tests and build pass. The new browser MIDI-monitor check exercises actual
Web Audio output, pitch bend, sustain, volume, voice limits and cleanup alongside
simulated Web MIDI capture/count-in/save. Existing MIDI lifecycle and overdub browser
checks pass. Hardware input/latency, idle keyboard audition, instrument selection,
track-routed monitoring and microphone monitoring remain pending.

### Microphone monitoring

Added opt-in microphone audition with independent -60..0 dB output level, default
-18 dB. A dedicated gain branch bypasses capture and the mixer; monitoring starts
during count-in. A live Mute/Unmute monitor control affects the current take without
changing its saved preference. Session fields `audioMonitorEnabled` and
`audioMonitorDb` are validated and undoable for both manual and agent changes.
Stopping, canceling, leaving or failing initialization disconnects the monitor.
Headphones are required to avoid acoustic feedback; no input latency compensation
or hardware direct-monitor integration is claimed.

175 tests and build pass. Browser verification uses a fake microphone and real Web
Audio: capture/placement/save, live mute/unmute, persistence, cancel/navigation
cleanup, and separate raw/monitored PCM channels showing monitor gain does not
alter the capture branch. Physical interfaces, output selection, track-routed input
FX, multiple simultaneous inputs and latency calibration remain pending.

### Marker editing and navigation

Markers now have a chronological editing panel, named add form, rename/time edits,
delete, previous/next navigation and clickable ruler diamonds. Navigation stops
playback, follows its current position and scrolls to the destination. Markers can
extend the visible timeline beyond media without changing bounce duration; ruler
labels are bounded to 1,000. Absolute marker positions survive tempo changes.
The agent shares `marker.add` (optional stable ID), `marker.set` and `marker.delete`
with manual actions through validated atomic batches and undo/redo.

177 tests and build pass. Browser verification covers creation/order, rename/move,
delete, jumps, undo/redo, escaping, reload and distant-marker rendering. Range
markers, arrangement sections and SMF marker import/export are still pending.

### MIDI marker interchange

SMF marker meta-events now round-trip through the conductor track. Import converts
marker ticks with the source tempo map and places them at the same start offset as
notes/controller tracks. Marker-only MIDI files work; IDs are fresh on each import.
The entire import remains atomic and undoable, including marker limits and bounds.
Export uses the current session tempo and 480 PPQ, so timing is tick-quantized;
source tempo maps are not preserved. UTF-8 works within Cuestamp, while non-ASCII
label compatibility with legacy DAWs is not verified. Cue-point events remain
unsupported. Reference: https://midi.org/standard-midi-files-specification

180 tests and build pass. Unit coverage includes a hand-authored tempo-change MIDI
fixture, label/timing round-trip, combined note/marker placement, fresh IDs, rollback
and undo. The browser marker check exports and re-imports an actual downloaded
marker-only MIDI file and verifies all markers are restored without creating empty
instrument tracks. Import into a third-party desktop DAW remains unverified.

### Time-range WAV export

Cycle controls now offer Bounce range WAV using the saved start/end independently
of the Cycle checkbox. It shares mix rendering, mute/solo, routing and WAV format
settings, snapshots state before asynchronous work and loads only intersecting
media. It exports the exact selected duration, including silence, with no appended
tail. Short ranges late in long sessions are allowed; each output is limited to ten
minutes. The existing seek renderer initializes automation/controllers but does not
reconstruct DSP history from earlier material. This is disclosed in the UI; full
context pre-roll, arbitrary-range stem ZIPs and seamless tail/crossfade handling
remain pending.

181 tests and build pass. Browser verification inspects actual float WAV samples
and frame counts for a range 1,001 seconds into a session, source position and
master automation, missing unrelated media, metronome exclusion, Cycle-off exports
and an empty silent range. Unit checks cover bounds, snapshot isolation and routing.

### Track duplication

Track actions now supports full duplication and a new empty track with the same
settings. Copies are inserted after the source, preserve outgoing routing, and
regenerate all editable IDs while sharing media references. Audio, MIDI, movie and
bus tracks are supported. A copied bus does not automatically receive routes from
existing tracks. The validated `track.duplicate` command is shared with the agent,
with optional id/name/includeRegions, full atomic validation and one-step undo.

185 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover every child ID, source independence,
settings-only/bus behavior, shared audio/video assets, invalid flags/IDs and limits.
Browser checks cover both actions, edits, undo/redo, reload and actual synthesized
PCM matching two copies of the original. Multi-track duplication, track templates
and duplication of entire routed groups remain pending.

### Moving regions between tracks

Added cross-track region drag/drop and inspector destination selection. Transfers
retain all source data/IDs and use the destination instrument/effects/routing.
The shared `region.move` command accepts destination trackId and optional timeline
start, rejecting incompatible types, buses and invalid placement atomically. UI
shows compatible/incompatible target lanes and preserves horizontal snap behavior.

187 tests and build pass. Browser checks exercise pure vertical drags, invalid
lane rejection, inspector transfer, undo/redo, reload and actual audio reflecting
destination gain. Unit checks cover all three region kinds, preserved source
references and atomic failure. Multi-region transfers, drag autoscroll and copying
regions between tracks without moving remain pending.

### Region repetition

The inspector offers Additional copies and Spacing in beats. The shared
`region.repeat` command creates 1–100 independent copies on the same track, using
source duration as default interval and preserving source/MIDI content while
regenerating editable IDs. All copies commit as one undoable operation with full
validation. Audio, MIDI and movie regions are supported; repetitions share media.
This is an arrangement editing operation, not linked aliases or a live looping
region. Gaps/overlaps are intentional when spacing differs from region duration.

189 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover all region kinds, IDs/references,
placement, rollback and limits. The browser check verifies beat spacing, one-step
undo/redo, independent note edits, reload and four rendered phrases separated by
silence. Linked region aliases, repeat-to-locator and multiple-region patterns
remain pending.

### Track reordering

Track name headers support before/after drag insertion with edge feedback. Move
track up/down provides an accessible alternative in Track actions. The shared
`track.move` command takes a zero-based final index, preserving track content,
identities and routing while changing document/arrangement/mixer order. Moves are
validated atomically and undoable. Drags from outside the workspace are ignored.

191 tests and build pass. Browser checks cover actual header dragging, lane order,
up/down boundary controls, undo/redo, reload and unchanged audio through preserved
bus routing. Unit coverage includes both insertion directions and invalid commands.
Multiple-track reordering, track folders and drag autoscroll remain pending.

### Live mixer metering

Added stereo track/bus meters after fader/pan and a master meter after master
processing. Metering branches have silent outputs and leave the audio signal
unchanged. Held sample peaks, reset controls, -60..0 dBFS bars and above-full-scale
indication are transient playback state. Offline exports allocate no meters.
Cycle playback exposes only its pre-rendered combined master (including metronome),
while unavailable strips show a dash. Stop disposes the analyser graph and clears UI.

192 tests and build pass. Real browser audio checks cover source/bus/master output,
stereo channel separation, >0 dBFS float headroom, held/reset peaks, Cycle, cleanup
and unchanged output samples. These are sampled 2,048-frame window peaks, not a
continuous clip counter or true-peak/loudness measurement. RMS/LUFS, limiter,
recording/agent meter telemetry and per-track Cycle metering remain pending.

### Measured playback context for agent edits

Agent requests now carry recent client-reported meter observations: session
identity/revision, age, position, mode and sampled current/held stereo peaks. These
survive Stop for two minutes, expire on edit/project replacement/reset, and remain
outside saved documents. Shared validation rejects stale, malformed, duplicated,
unknown or inconsistent readings before model access. Cycle only permits master
telemetry. Prompt guidance distinguishes sampled observations from full-file
analysis, accounts for automation overriding static gain and requires replay to
verify estimated adjustments. No audio data is sent with these observations.

194 tests and build pass. Browser verification uses actual playback measurements
with mocked model responses to inspect request context, after-stop availability,
revision invalidation and no persistence. Unit checks verify context propagation
and rejection before provider calls. Real model behavior, continuous analysis,
agent-triggered playback/measurement and loudness-aware mixing remain unverified
or pending.

### Per-region mute

Regions now have a persisted mute flag controlled in the inspector and by shared
`region.set` commands. Muting retains all material, IDs and timing, while playback
and WAV rendering exclude that region and skip its source decoding. Timeline and
bounce duration remain aligned. MIDI exports omit muted regions/tracks; project
archives retain everything. MIDI serialization can explicitly include muted content
internally, but the standard format cannot preserve a mute flag. Movie lookup skips
muted regions as well. Solo does not affect MIDI export.

196 tests and build pass. Browser verification covers visual state, independent
regions on one track, undo/redo/reload, playback with unavailable muted media, WAV
samples proving silence/audible separation and downloaded MIDI note omission.
Unit checks cover defaults, asset planning, history and MIDI filtering. Bulk region
mute controls and a dedicated MIDI export options panel remain pending.

### MIDI takes into existing instrument tracks

MIDI capture now offers an explicit destination selector. New-track capture stays
the default, while an existing instrument track receives a new region at the take
start with all prior material/settings intact. Destination is fixed through capture
and save retry. Existing-track takes are allowed at the session track cap and
respect per-track region limits. Shared `midi.import` supports optional trackId,
appending imported regions atomically without changing track settings.

Live audition follows destination oscillator/drum-kit choice. Drum synthesis reuses
existing deterministic buffers with bounded voices, natural one-shot completion
and stop cleanup. Monitoring remains separate from the destination mixer chain.
198 tests and build pass. Synthetic-device browser checks verify destination saves,
prior region preservation, undo/redo, count-in behavior, square-wave selection,
drum one-shot output and cleanup. Unit checks cover limits and atomic invalid
imports. Hardware latency, audio takes into existing tracks, MIDI merge/replace,
take lanes, punch and track-routed monitoring remain pending.

### Audio takes into existing tracks

Audio capture now offers explicit new/existing audio destinations. The destination
and starting position are fixed for the take; appending preserves existing regions,
track controls and routing. Completed media is validated before storage and uses
one shared command batch for undo. Existing tracks can receive takes at the session
track limit, with their own region cap checked before microphone access. New-track
capture remains the default and destination selection is transient.

200 tests and build pass. Fake-microphone browser checks inspect saved PCM, chosen
track/start, prior-region preservation, mixer settings, undo/redo and cancel/leave
cleanup. Unit checks exercise planning without mutation, limits and incompatible
or missing targets. Take lanes, replace/punch modes, comping and hardware latency
calibration remain pending; overlapping takes currently play together.

### Audio input selection

Recording now offers a local Audio input selector with system default, visible
microphones/interfaces, refresh and device-change updates. The selected device is
captured before preparation and requested with an exact constraint. Missing inputs
remain visibly selected/unavailable; recording errors do not retry another device.
Selection and refresh controls lock during takes. Device IDs never enter project
JSON or agent commands. Enumeration does not request microphone access; device
names may remain hidden until permission, after which recording refreshes them.

203 unit tests and production build pass. The browser check records from a chosen
synthetic microphone, checks the exact request, rejects a missing input without a
fallback, saves actual PCM, and verifies undo/redo and cancellation cleanup. Its
headless Chromium disables hardware audio output so the audio clock runs without
an output device. Physical interfaces, multichannel input assignment, output-device
selection and latency calibration remain unverified/pending.

### Mono/stereo recording channel selection

Audio input controls now select stereo/native capture or extract input 1/2 into a
mono take. The selection precedes capture and monitoring, so saved WAVs have one
channel for mono and monitoring is centered. Input 2 requests a minimum of two
channels and rejects a reported mono stream with cleanup. Settings remain local
and fixed during takes; no project schema or agent command is needed for hardware
setup. This covers the first two browser-exposed channels, not arbitrary multichannel
interface routing or simultaneous independent track capture.

205 tests and build pass. Browser checks save a UI-created mono take and inspect
actual PCM from separate +0.2/-0.4 synthetic channels for all three modes. Offline
monitor renders confirm stereo separation and centered mono. Tests also verify
unavailable-channel rejection, device cleanup and control locking. Real hardware
channel maps/latency remain unverified, and broader recording/comping remains open.

### Local session backup recovery

The existing per-account backup slot now has a preview/confirm recovery action and
raw JSON download. Validated backups reopen as independent local copies, preserving
arrangement and media IDs while resetting document identity/revision and undo/agent
history. The current session replaces the backup, allowing a subsequent recovery
back to it. Corrupt or stale backups do not replace the session; quota failures
restore the original backup. Missing media is reported before confirmation and is
not falsely represented as recovered. No account write happens automatically.

208 tests and build pass. Browser coverage verifies preview/cancel, missing-media
notice, new identity, exact track preservation, swap, reload, corrupt backup
preservation/download and absence of cloud writes. Unit tests exercise account-key
isolation, revision reset, stale backup and storage rollback. Timestamped history,
cloud autosave and recovery of media deleted from the device remain pending.

### Visual MIDI velocity editing

A velocity lane now sits below the piano roll. Its vertical controls support
pointer and keyboard input, selected-group relative adjustment, individual-note
editing, displayed MIDI values, and one-step undo/redo. It shares horizontal
scroll with the piano grid; same-time notes are placed side by side. Shared
`notes.velocity` commands support absolute or relative changes to selected/all
notes with validation, independent clamping, and atomic history; the agent prompt
includes the command. Note pitch, timing and channel are preserved.

210 tests and build pass. Browser checks cover actual keyboard/pointer edits,
selection scope, persistence, keyboard focus and undo/redo. Unit checks cover
clamping, absolute-zero velocity and rollback for invalid values/selections.
Real model execution remains unverified. This is a note-velocity lane; graphical
controller/pitch-bend lanes and continuous expression recording remain pending.

### Graphical MIDI controller lane

Expression, volume, pan, sustain and pitch bend now have channel-filtered timeline
points below the piano roll. Users can add or drag points, nudge time/value with
keys, reset defaults/limits and delete. The lane displays step holds and controller
defaults; Shift bypasses time snap. It uses existing validated event commands and
atomic history, so playback/export and agent edits share the same data. Exact-time
clicks update an existing point; imported event forms remain available.

212 unit tests and production build pass. Browser checks cover point creation,
same-time update, MIDI-channel isolation, full pitch-bend limits and exact center,
keyboard/delete, pointer drag, persistence and undo. Unit checks cover filtering,
sorting without mutation, snap/bounds and coordinate ranges. Freehand/ramp drawing,
pressure lanes and live controller automation workflows remain pending.

### MIDI controller ramps

Controller lanes now include a ramp form with beat-based range/spacing, value
endpoints and linear/ease-in/ease-out curves. Shared `event.ramp` uses seconds and
is available to the agent. It replaces matching controller/channel points in the
inclusive range, retains exact endpoints, preserves all unrelated events, and
commits as one reversible edit. Generated points are evenly spaced no farther
apart than requested, bounded at 2,000 per ramp and the region event cap.

215 tests and build pass. Browser checks verify form conversion, visible points,
channel/type preservation, full-resolution pitch bend, curves, single undo/redo,
and MIDI export/re-import. Offline rendering confirms rising expression changes
the audio amplitude. Unit tests check endpoint values, nonmutation, preservation,
limits and atomic rollback. Ramps remain sampled MIDI steps; freehand drawing and
continuous controller automation recording remain pending. Live agent inference
has not been verified for this command.

### Explicit chord entry

The piano roll now offers root/octave, named chord quality, inversion, timing,
velocity and channel controls with an exact pitch preview. Common triads, sevenths,
suspended chords and power fifths insert ordinary editable notes, retaining existing
material. Shared `notes.chord` commands validate pitch/inversion, region bounds and
note capacity, and use one undo step. The agent prompt permits these only for
explicit chord requests, without inventing progressions or generating audio.

218 tests and build pass. Browser checks verify previews, inversion choices,
resulting note pitch/timing/channel, preservation, undo/redo, invalid register
rejection and MIDI export/re-import. Unit checks cover chord intervals, inversion
ranges, IDs, capacity and atomic rollback. Live model execution remains unverified;
scale/key maps, chord tracks, notation, custom voicings and extended harmony tools
remain pending.

### Preserve editing state during redraws

Audio input enumeration now updates only its controls, preventing a device-change
notification from closing editor panels or discarding unfinished forms. Whole
workspace redraws retain panel expansion and same-region editor scroll. Background
initial load additionally preserves fields, focus and text selection. This state
is local to the rendered view, not part of the project document.

218 tests and build pass. A browser regression delays configuration loading while
text is entered, emits device changes while a chord form is unfinished, and checks
text/focus/selection, form preservation, expanded panels, editor scroll and undo.
Chord, controller-ramp and selected-input recording browser regressions also pass.
A broader incremental-rendering architecture and persistent layouts remain pending.

### Key/scale pitch editing and piano guides

The piano roll now provides scale-based pitch mapping for a selection or whole
region, with root, named scale/mode, direction, tie resolution, change-count preview
and optional in-scale row highlighting. Shared `notes.scale` commands change only
pitch, preserving IDs, timing, velocity and channels, and commit in one undo step.
In-scale notes stay in place; converging notes are not merged. Highlighting does
not restrict note drawing. The agent prompt exposes the same command and requires
an explicit intended key rather than guessing one.

221 tests and build pass. Unit coverage exercises all MIDI pitches for each scale
and root, selection validation, ties, directions, boundary rejection and atomic
history. Browser coverage checks previews, selected/all scope, key highlighting,
nonmutation before Apply, preserved non-pitch fields, settings and undo. Persisted
key-signature maps, score notation and diatonic transposition remain pending; real
model execution is unverified.

### Single-sample MIDI instrument

Sampler tracks now use an uploaded/existing audio source and root MIDI pitch.
Notes drive pitched buffer voices through the MIDI controller, region, track, bus
and master paths. Velocity, sustain and ±2-semitone bend apply; seeking integrates
prior bend rates for source position. Live MIDI audition supports the same sample.
Upload assignment creates no extra track and is undoable. Sample dependencies flow
through decode, recording accompaniment, bounces, cloud saving/validation and
portable archive remapping. Account projects cannot omit sampler source mappings.

224 tests and build pass. Browser rendering checks root/octave frequency, source
assignment/root undo, bounce assets, live voice cleanup, stored source reload and
mock cloud save/restore mapping. Unit tests cover sample settings, muted dependency
selection, unchanged archive media bytes/shared remapping, server asset validation
and pitch-bend seek offsets. Real cloud deployment, hardware latency and real-model
execution were not verified in this change. This is one sample per track; looping,
multisample zones, layers, slicing, envelope controls and independent time stretching
remain pending. Pitch currently changes playback speed and sample duration.

### Sampler sustain loops

Sampler tracks now store optional source loop points. Manual assignment and shared
track commands use the same settings; decoded source validation rejects out-of-file
or sub-sample loops. Scheduled and live voices loop until the MIDI note ends, and
seeking wraps the integrated source position into the loop. Uploading a replacement
sample clears prior loop points. Existing unlooped behavior stays available.

234 tests and build pass. Browser checks compare real looped/unlooped rendering
beyond source duration, verify seek output and silence after note end, and exercise
live held/released voices, inspector controls, undo and bad source bounds. Unit
checks cover first-pass offsets, wrap math, sample bounds and atomic document
validation. Crossfade loops, graphical loop-point selection, zero-crossing helpers,
multisample zones and editable envelopes remain pending.

### Graphical sampler loop selection

Sampler sources now have a waveform overview with a selected loop band and keyboard-
accessible edge handles. Drawing a range and moving edges update draft form values,
snap to source frames, and commit only through Use sampler. Cancel restores the
prior draft. Numeric fields redraw the band; cached sources appear immediately,
and Load waveform decodes a selected source after reload without changing the
project. One-frame loop validation now tolerates floating-point roundoff.

237 tests and build pass. Browser checks cover drag selection, keyboard changes,
cancellation, draft isolation, apply/undo/redo and reload. Unit checks cover range
ordering/clamping, one-frame spans, stereo/silent/short-buffer waveform generation
and source-data preservation. Waveform zoom, zero-crossing snapping and crossfade
loops remain pending; the overview samples peaks and normalizes display amplitude.

Audio input enumeration now times out after five seconds with a retryable message,
preventing a stalled browser device API from leaving Refresh inputs disabled. A
unit test verifies timeout and successful retry. The sampler inspector screenshot
was visually checked after the browser regression passed.

### Sampler amplitude envelope

Sampler tracks now expose attack and decay (0–10 seconds), sustain level (0–1),
and release (0–30 seconds). Use sampler commits them as one undoable change.
Shared track.add/set fields are sampleAttack, sampleDecay, sampleSustain and
sampleRelease; defaults are 0.005, 0, 1 and 0.02 respectively. The editing agent
receives these controls through the same validated command schema.

The amplitude rises during attack, falls to sustain during decay, and fades from
its current level after note-off or sustain-pedal release. Early note-off releases
from the current attack/decay value. Arrangement notes are gated at region end;
release can continue beyond it unless a region fade silences it. Looping samples
continue looping during release. An unlooped sample can end before the envelope.
Playback, accompaniment, offline bounces and live MIDI monitoring share envelope
settings. Mix/stem/region exports reserve release tails, and range/seek playback
can resume inside a release; exact range exports still stop at the requested end.
Source audio is never rewritten.

Validation: 240 unit/integration tests and production build pass. The sampler,
loop and new envelope browser checks pass. Real Web Audio renders verify amplitude
at attack/decay/sustain/release points, early note-off, instant decay at the attack
boundary and post-region seeking. The browser also verifies controls/undo/redo
and live monitor voice lifetime. Physical MIDI hardware and live model inference
remain unverified. Multi-sample zones/layers, loop crossfades and filter/modulation
envelopes remain pending.

### Effect parameter automation

The mixer now has an Automate section below each effect, using the same editable
curve interface as volume/pan. Track, bus and master chains support EQ frequency,
Q and gain; compressor threshold/ratio/attack/release/knee; delay time/feedback/mix;
and reverb wet mix. Reverb decay, filter type and bypass remain static. EQ gain and
Q retain the selected filter type's Web Audio semantics (for example, lowpass does
not use gain). Curves use absolute project seconds, interpolate linearly in their
displayed units, hold the first/last value outside their points, and override static
controls. Clear the parameter curve to return to its static value.

Shared commands: effect.automation.point targets an effect ID with parameter,
time, value and optional id; a matching parameter/time updates the existing point.
effect.automation.set targets a point ID with time/value; delete targets a point;
clear targets an effect with parameter. Supported ranges match static controls.
Each effect allows 2,000 points; unsupported parameters, out-of-range values,
duplicate times/IDs and invalid batches are rejected. Undo/redo and local/cloud/
archive documents retain the curves; track duplication gives their points fresh
IDs. The agent prompt documents the new validated operations.

Playback and offline exports schedule native effect AudioParams and chase curve
values when seeking. EQ gain remains in decibels (unlike a channel GainNode).
Wet/dry gains use complementary mix curves. Delay export tails reserve automated
maximum time/feedback/mix within the existing 30-second per-chain cap. Seeking
still does not reconstruct earlier delay/reverb/compressor state. Automation write/
touch/latch recording and alternative interpolation curves remain pending.

244 tests and build pass. New unit checks cover all supported parameter ranges,
transaction rollback, point operations, master/bus handling, duplication, JSON
persistence, seek scheduling and tail estimates. Browser checks cover controls,
millisecond parameter precision, undo/reload, an audible offline filter sweep,
seek continuity and every native effect parameter's final value. Existing track/
send automation drag, keyboard, numeric-edit and persistence checks pass; the
browser test now waits for fonts before measuring drag coordinates. The mixer
screenshot was visually inspected. Live model inference remains unverified.

Implementation reference: native EQ gain uses decibels, and native AudioParam
linear ramps interpolate parameter values:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam/linearRampToValueAtTime

### Audio crossfades and fade curves

Select an audio region and use Crossfade in the region inspector to choose an
overlapping region on the same track. Linear and equal-power modes set the earlier
region's fade-out and later region's fade-in across the entire overlap in one
undoable edit. Positions, source offsets and recordings remain unchanged. One
region must start and end earlier than the other; touching, separated, contained
or different-track regions are rejected. Existing outer fades must leave room.
The form shows eligible pairs and explains the overlap requirement when none fit.

Shared command: region.crossfade targets either region with otherRegionId and
optional shape (linear or equalPower, default equalPower). region.set also accepts
fadeInShape/fadeOutShape (default linear) independently of fadeIn/fadeOut duration.
Curves work for audio and MIDI region gain envelopes; paired crossfades are audio
only. The agent prompt documents the operation and constraints. Timeline envelopes
show curved shapes. Shapes persist through saves, duplication and trimming.

Equal-power curves use complementary sine fades, approximated with 64 linear
segments per fade in playback/export. Linear fades preserve the summed amplitude
of identical aligned material; equal-power fades preserve the sum of squared gains
and can boost correlated material. Existing region gains and downstream effects
still apply. Seek starts at the proper envelope value. These are paired edits,
not linked region objects: reapply after moving/trimming a pair. Automatic overlap
creation, persistent crossfade links and adjustable curve tension remain pending.

248 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover paired edits/undo, rejection and atomic
rollback, energy/amplitude relationships, shape persistence and unchanged source
references. The browser verifies the form, fade drawing, independent curve edits,
undo/reload, real stereo linear/equal-power renders, seek and stem rendering. The
crossfade inspector was visually inspected. This is incremental progress on the
full DAW scope; hardware recording and live model execution remain unverified.

### MIDI legato and overlap correction

The piano roll now includes Legato & note lengths. Connect note lengths adjusts
selected or all notes to the next strictly later onset in the same MIDI channel.
Simultaneous notes are treated as a chord. Shorten overlaps only never extends a
note. A gap in milliseconds leaves space before the next onset; a negative gap
creates overlap. Choose all notes or only the changed selection as the source of
following boundaries, and optionally require the same pitch. Notes with no next
onset keep their length by default, or use the region end. A live preview reports
how many notes will change and disables invalid/no-op submissions.

Shared command notes.legato targets a MIDI region with mode legato/shorten, gap
in seconds (-10..10), following all/selected, match channel/pitch, last keep/
regionEnd, and optional noteId or comma-separated noteIds. Defaults are legato,
0, all, channel and keep. Omit selection fields to edit the region's notes.
Region-end fallback ignores gap; overlaps are capped at the region boundary.
A zero/negative note length or result over the 3,600-second note limit rejects
the entire command. Onsets, pitches, channels, velocities and controller events
stay unchanged. Plans use sorted onset groups and binary search for large regions.
One batch is one undo step, and note lengths persist and export through MIDI.
The editing-agent prompt documents the operation. It edits MIDI gate duration;
sustain pedals, instrument release tails, glide and sample articulations remain
separate behaviors.

253 tests and the production build pass. Unit checks cover chords/channels,
selection versus following-note scope, matching pitches, gaps/overlaps, final-note
policy, shortening, atomic rollback/undo, MIDI roundtrip and 20,000 unsorted notes.
The browser checks preview/validation, selected/all edits, undo/reload, visible
controls and an offline audio render showing the former gap now sounding. The
existing piano inspector, drag/resize, duplicate/delete and persistence checks
also pass. The controls were visually inspected. The full DAW objective and live
model validation remain ongoing.

https://help.apple.com/logicpro/mac/9.1.6/en/logicpro/usermanual/chapter_23_section_3.html

### Agent follow-up context and request isolation

The editing agent now receives recent conversation turns alongside the current
session. Each turn records the instruction, response, outcome, before/after
revisions and up to 20 actual entity deltas (for example, track gain 0 to -6 dB).
This supplies context for follow-ups such as making a previous reduction smaller.
Failed, canceled and discarded requests have no applied deltas. Track/effect order,
region ownership and send settings are included; metadata fields are explanatory,
not new editable command fields. The latest session remains authoritative after
manual edits or undo. Historical text is sent as untrusted data, never as a new
privileged instruction. Server checks reject mismatched session IDs, future
revisions, unsupported fields and oversized history before model invocation.

History is kept in memory while the page is open: at most eight turns and 24,000
serialized characters. Each turn is capped at 12,000 serialized characters;
truncated deltas/text are marked. It is cleared on session replacement/import,
page reload or Clear conversation and is not saved with audio projects. The model
request keeps store:false and includes bounded summaries as current request data,
not provider conversation IDs or replayed reasoning/tool calls.

Cancel request aborts the browser fetch and prevents late application; it does not
guarantee an already-running upstream model request stops billing. Leaving the
workspace or replacing its history aborts pending work. Responses must match the
original SessionHistory object, session ID, revision and active workspace before
any edit or conversational reply is accepted. Failed revision checks are recorded
as discarded. If an edit changes in-memory state but device persistence fails,
the UI and follow-up history say that it applied but could not be saved, rather
than incorrectly claiming no edit occurred.

257 tests and build pass. Server/unit checks cover actual edit deltas, size caps,
identity/revision rejection, send/order/deletion metadata and context forwarding.
A browser test with mocked model replies verifies follow-up context, manual-edit
races, cancellation, clearing, switching sessions and a simulated storage failure.
The agent panel was visually inspected. Live model inference, multi-step tool
loops, persisted conversation history and model-side request cancellation remain
unverified or pending; this does not complete the full DAW objective.

### Full-mix sample analysis

Analyze mix below the mixer renders the complete stereo arrangement at the sample
rate selected in Export settings (44.1, 48 or 96 kHz). It uses the same offline
engine as bounce, including instrument envelopes, fades, effects, automation,
routing and effect tails. Mute/solo apply; the metronome is excluded. The existing
10-minute offline-render limit applies. Source decoding and the render use browser
memory; a dedicated worker scans copied channel buffers so sample scanning does
not block the main UI. Worker buffers are transferred and the worker terminates
on completion, error, abort or a 60-second scan timeout.

The panel reports per-channel and combined sample peak, RMS mean-square level,
and the number of samples whose absolute value exceeds one. RMS includes silence
and tails over the entire render. Zero-energy channels display Silence. Go to
loudest sample moves the playhead to the first occurrence of the greatest sample
magnitude. These are sample-domain measurements, not true-peak or LUFS; over-range
output is not evidence that an earlier source was clipped.

Analysis is kept only in page memory and becomes stale after any session revision.
The panel marks stale results and disables peak navigation; agent requests omit
stale results. A session replacement clears them. Valid current results are sent
as optional mixAnalysis alongside the existing short-window meter readings. Server
validation checks session/revision, expected rendered frame count, timestamp,
channel consistency and render bounds. Data remains client-reported; the prompt
uses it as measurement context rather than instructions, differentiates final-mix
from individual-track levels, and requires reanalysis after edits. No automatic
normalization or agent-driven render loop is implemented by this change.

261 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover peak/RMS arithmetic, silence, polarity,
over-range counts, invalid samples, scope/revision checks and agent forwarding.
Real browser renders and workers verify normal and over-range audio, silence,
peak navigation, stale-context omission, an edit during rendering, worker error/
cancellation and preservation of the rendered buffer. Model responses are mocked;
live inference remains unverified. Existing agent conversation/race checks also
pass. The analysis panel was visually inspected. Full DAW parity remains ongoing.

### Master sample-peak normalization

After Analyze mix, set Target sample peak (-60 to 0 dBFS) and Apply peak target.
The adjustment offsets the master fader and every master gain automation point
by the same decibel amount, preserving the curve, pan and insert settings. It is
one undoable session edit, followed automatically by a fresh full-mix render.
The measured result is displayed; a failed or interrupted reanalysis does not
undo the level adjustment. Undo is available, and old measurements remain stale.
Targets already within 0.001 dB, silent mixes, stale analysis and adjustments
outside the master/automation range (-96 to +12 dB) cannot be applied. The target
is a transient UI preference, not saved project data. This changes the session's
master level for playback and export; it is not an export-only setting, limiter,
LUFS normalization or true-peak protection. Analysis respects mute/solo.

Shared command master.gain.offset accepts deltaDb (-108..108) and optional current
session ID. It validates all resulting levels before committing; it never silently
clips the automation curve. The agent prompt documents deriving the offset from
current full-mix measurements and a requested target, and requiring new analysis
afterward. The agent itself does not yet initiate an analysis tool loop.

264 unit/server tests and the build pass. Browser verification uses real offline
renders to reach a -12 dBFS target with master automation, pan and an EQ insert,
checks preserved automation/effects and undo, and rejects stale/silent use. The
analysis panel was visually inspected. Provider responses remain mocked in this
test; live model inference and the broader DAW scope remain ongoing.

### Export master-processing options

Export settings now offers Include master processing (the default), Bypass master
inserts, and Bypass entire master. Insert bypass removes only master effects and
their tails; master gain/pan and their automation remain. Entire-master bypass
also sets unity master gain, centered pan and no master automation in the export
snapshot. Track/bus inserts, faders, automation, routing and sends stay included.
The setting applies to mix, individual/grouped stems, selected-region and range
bounces. Range duration stays exact; other exports omit bypassed master tails.
Playback, mix analysis, saved documents and undo history are unchanged. Export
settings remain transient UI state. Analyze mix describes the processed playback
mix, so its measured peak is not a measurement of a bypassed export. Bypassing
master processing does not eliminate nonlinear processing shared across buses.

265 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover every bounce mode, tail durations,
invalid settings and source-document immutability. Real downloaded browser WAVs
verify insert attenuation, retained gain automation/pan, entire-master bypass
against an unprocessed reference and grouped-stem reconstruction. The session
export confirms original master settings remain intact. The older browser script
was updated to respect preserved disclosure state rather than toggling an already
open panel closed. Export settings were visually inspected. Broader DAW scope,
agent-controlled exports and live model validation remain ongoing.

### Reverse MIDI note timing

The piano roll has a Reverse note timing panel with all/selected-note scope and
phrase/entire-region bounds. Phrase bounds use the earliest selected start and
latest selected end. The operation mirrors complete note intervals, preserving
lengths, pitches, velocities, channels and IDs. Repeating it restores the original
phrase (within floating-point precision). Unequal-length notes that originally
start together may start at different times after interval reversal. Controller
events, sustain pedal, instrument envelopes and audio samples are not reversed.
A preview counts moved notes; empty selection and no-op submissions are disabled.

Shared command notes.reverse targets a MIDI region with optional bounds phrase
(default) or region, plus noteId or comma-separated noteIds. Omit selection fields
for all notes. The formula is boundStart + boundEnd - start - duration. Invalid
selection, unsupported fields, non-MIDI targets and out-of-region results reject
the atomic batch. The editing-agent prompt describes the command. One operation
is one undo step and changes persist in the ordinary session document.

267 tests and build pass. Unit checks verify interval positions, preserved note
attributes/controller events, two-pass reversal, undo/redo and invalid-batch
rollback. Browser checks cover phrase/region modes, selection/no-op feedback,
undo/reload and actual offline audio showing the note moved out of its original
time window. The panel was visually inspected. Live model execution and broader
DAW parity remain unverified or ongoing.

Reference: Apple's MIDI Transform documentation describes reversing selected
positions around a pivot. This implementation explicitly mirrors note intervals:
https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/logicpro/lgcp21584fd3/10.7/mac/11.0

### Gain and stereo utility insert

The mixer effect selector now includes Gain / Stereo utility for tracks, buses
and the master. Gain spans -96 to +24 dB; width spans 0 to 2 (1 preserves stereo,
0 averages L/R into both outputs, 2 doubles the side component). Independent
left/right polarity switches apply before width; Swap left/right applies after
width. Mono inputs are speaker-upmixed to both channels before this matrix.
The insert adds no tail and follows normal chain order, bypass and export rules.
Source media stays unchanged. Polarity inversion may improve or worsen summed
recordings; it is not a timing correction or frequency-dependent phase rotation.

Shared effect.add/set kind gain supports gainDb, width, invertLeft, invertRight
and swap, in addition to enabled. Defaults are 0 dB, width 1 and false switches.
Gain and width support the existing effect automation commands and graphical
editor. Gain ramps interpolate in dB using exponential amplitude ramps; width
coefficients interpolate linearly. Seeking initializes the interpolated values.
Polarity and swap remain static. The agent prompt documents these settings.

268 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover validation, automated values, tail
behavior and atomic rollback/undo. Browser audio checks verify stereo identity,
mono averaging, widening, each-channel sign behavior, swap, cancellation,
operation order, mono upmix, gain, bypass, automation and seek. UI checks verify
checkbox/numeric editing, undo/redo and persistence; the panel was visually
inspected. Broader DAW parity and live model verification remain ongoing.

https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/logicpro/lgcef2d8c650/mac

### Agent-requested mix analysis

The editing agent can now request analyze_mix when a level question or edit needs
current full-mix sample measurements. The browser renders and measures the same
unchanged session, then makes a fresh planning request with the original user
instruction, document, selection, bounded conversation and validated mixAnalysis.
This is a stateless two-request workflow: no raw provider reasoning or tool-call
history is replayed. The application supplies the measured data as normal context.
The server exposes the empty-argument analysis tool only when allowAnalysis is
true and current measurements are absent. Old clients default to false. Mixed
analysis/edit responses, unknown tools, invalid arguments and multiple calls are
rejected. The second request disables analysis, preventing repeated render loops.

Each user submission permits at most one render and two model requests, with a
five-minute overall browser deadline (each server model request still has its
90-second timeout). The browser checks session identity/revision before analysis,
after rendering and before edits. Analysis uses the original playback master,
not export-bypass settings. Cancellation prevents continuation and cancels sample
scanning; an already running OfflineAudioContext render or source decode may finish
before cancellation unwinds. Upstream model cancellation is not guaranteed.
Missing media/render failures stop the request without edits. A successful edit
remains one undo step. Its previous measurements become stale; automatic post-edit
verification, per-track measurements, LUFS and true-peak are still pending.

269 tests and build pass. Server tests cover tool availability, strict arguments,
current/stale measurement rules and mixed-tool rejection. Browser tests perform
real rendering and worker scanning with mocked model responses, then apply a
measurement-derived edit. They verify cancellation during rendering, an intervening
manual edit, repeated-tool rejection and render failure cleanup. Existing agent
conversation, persistence-failure and session-isolation tests also pass. The agent
panel was visually inspected. Live model inference is not verified by these tests.

Official OpenAI function-calling documentation (application executes tool code and
makes a subsequent model request with results):
https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling

### Post-edit mix verification

Agent edit plans now accept optional verifyMix=true. After applying the batch,
the browser renders and measures the new full mix and reports its actual sample
peak and over-range sample count in the agent log. master.gain.offset always
triggers this verification. The post-edit render uses normal playback processing,
not export-bypass settings; it adds no undo step and performs no further edits.
The model response before execution cannot claim the measurement already occurred.
Successful fresh results become current mixAnalysis for future requests. This
extends the bounded workflow to at most two renders (one prerequisite and one
verification) and two model requests per submission under the existing five-minute
overall deadline. There is no extra model call for the verification report.

Canceling or failing verification keeps the already applied edit and clearly
reports that verification did not complete; the user can undo it. History captures
the exact post-command snapshot before verification starts, so intervening manual
edits are not attributed to the agent. Old measurement results are rejected if the
session changes during rendering. Model-request timeouts no longer incorrectly
say no edits were applied after an edit has succeeded. The log follows new output
when already at the bottom and preserves a user's scrolled-back reading position.

270 tests and build pass. Browser tests use real audio renders to verify a -12 dBFS
post-edit peak, current analysis display and conversation history, cancellation
after application, manual-edit races during verification, preserved undo and
scroll behavior. Existing conversation, cancellation, persistence-failure and
session-isolation checks pass. The verification report was visually inspected.
Model responses remain mocked; live inference, automatic corrective iterations,
per-track analysis, true-peak/LUFS and the broader DAW scope remain ongoing.

### Unsent agent instruction drafts

The instruction textarea now keeps account- and session-scoped drafts separately
from project documents, so mixer/selection changes, analysis and other redraws do
not erase typing or change the project revision. Drafts are stored on this device
under the account namespace, bounded to ten recently edited sessions and 6,000
characters each. Reload restores the current session's draft. Switching sessions
shows that session's own draft, never the previous project's instruction. Text is
escaped when rendered; drafts are not automatically submitted or sent to the model.
Storage failure retains text in memory and shows that the page must remain open.

A request leaves its instruction available while running. Successful replies or
applied edits clear only the unchanged submitted draft; typing a new instruction
while waiting protects the newer text. Failed/canceled/discarded requests retain
the draft for retry. Already-applied edits count as applied even if verification
fails, avoiding an automatic retry of an edit that already happened. Clear
conversation leaves unsent text alone. Draft storage does not persist model
conversation history or provide cross-device sync. Active textarea focus and
selection survive same-session redraws without overwriting newer draft state.

272 tests and build pass. Unit tests cover account/session isolation, reload,
version-aware clearing, limits and storage failure. Browser checks cover escaped
text, repaint/reload, caret selection, typing during a pending request, success,
failure, cancel, switching projects and memory fallback. The measured-edit and
post-edit verification browser workflow also passes. The draft indicator was
visually inspected. Live model verification and the broader DAW scope remain ongoing.

### Live editing-agent connection check

Added npm run check:daw-agent, which loads ignored local environment settings and
uses the real configured adapter for at most two planning requests against a
synthetic, disposable session. It checks exact post-command state, including an
untouched second track, then sends actual conversation deltas for a follow-up.
The requested gains are -6 dB followed by half the reduction (-3 dB). Invalid,
stale, absent or extra edits fail. No project, audio, credentials or provider
payload is written or printed. Failures report only the stage and safe guidance.
The --config-only option checks required variables without provider calls.

The local preflight currently fails because OPENAI_API_KEY and DAW_AGENT_MODEL are
both absent; no live model request was made. Configure them server-side in ignored
.env.local, restart the API, and run the full check to obtain live evidence. A pass
would establish these two adapter/edit behaviors, not complete DAW reliability,
production authentication, metering, quota enforcement or general model accuracy.
Unit tests use injected planners and do not establish live inference. They verify
preflight request suppression, actual state comparisons, follow-up context, stale
and unrelated edit rejection, and error redaction. The broader goal remains active.

### MIDI phrase time scaling

Scale note timing in the piano roll changes spacing from either the first chosen
note or the region start. It supports all/selected notes, 6.25% to 1600% scaling,
and Double speed (50%) / Half speed (200%) presets. Scale note lengths is enabled
by default; disabling it changes onsets only. Preview counts changed notes and
shows the resulting phrase end. Notes that exceed the region reject the edit
unless Extend region to fit is enabled. That option grows the region only; it
never shrinks it or moves neighboring regions. Its existing fade-out therefore
moves later. Controllers, pitches, velocities, channels, tempo and other regions
stay unchanged. This edits MIDI timing, not audio time-stretching or tempo maps.

Shared notes.timeScale targets a MIDI region with required factor 0.0625..16,
anchor phrase/region (default phrase), scaleLengths (default true), extendRegion
(default false), and optional noteId or comma-separated noteIds. Onset formula:
anchor + (oldStart - anchor) * factor. Lengths scale only when requested. Results
must respect 3,600-second note and 86,400-second region limits; invalid selections
or values reject the entire batch. Chords retain aligned starts. It is one undo
step, persists normally and exports through MIDI. The agent prompt documents it.

279 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover chords, preserved metadata/events,
selection and anchors, lengths/onsets, region extension, rollback, undo/redo and
MIDI roundtrip. Browser checks exercise presets and custom input, selection,
validation, undo/reload and a real offline render showing the earlier note onset.
The controls were visually inspected. Live model configuration and the broader
DAW parity work remain ongoing.

https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/logicpro/lgcp4a739b4b/10.7/mac/11.0

### Full-mix stereo compatibility measurements

Mix analysis now also reports stereo correlation, mono-average RMS and stereo-
difference RMS. A worker computes normalized cross-product sum(L*R) / sqrt(sum(L²)
* sum(R²)) over every rendered sample, without mean subtraction. Correlation is
null when either channel has zero energy. Mono average is (L+R)/2 and stereo
difference is (L-R)/2; their RMS includes the entire render, silence and tails.
Zero energy displays Silence. +1 means matching shapes, not necessarily equal
levels. Negative correlation indicates possible mono cancellation; complete
cancellation also requires matched amplitudes. These full-render values can hide
brief problems and are not a windowed correlation meter, LUFS or true-peak check.

Optional mixAnalysis.stereo is validated against channel RMS power and forwarded
to the agent with interpretation limits. Validation uses absolute error relative
to total energy to avoid unstable division with an extremely quiet nonzero channel.
Older measurement payloads without stereo data remain accepted; absent data is
never inferred. Revision checks and stale UI handling apply to all measurements.
The render-worker helper now returns {channels,stereo}; it still transfers copies
and terminates on completion, error or cancellation.

282 tests and build pass. Unit cases cover identical, opposite-polarity, unequal-
level, uncorrelated and silent channels, invalid inputs, power consistency,
extreme level imbalance and agent forwarding. Browser renders verify a centered
mono signal and an inverted-right master utility producing -1 correlation with
silent mono fold-down, plus worker errors/cancellation and existing normalization.
Agent-requested analysis and post-edit verification also pass. That browser check
now waits for fonts before asserting scroll geometry. The panel was visually
inspected. Live inference, momentary correlation and broader DAW parity remain open.

Reference: Apple's correlation meter and mono compatibility guidance:
https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/logicpro/lgcef24f430f/mac

### Stretch a complete MIDI region

The MIDI region inspector now includes Stretch MIDI region. Enter a new duration
or use Half length / Double length, review the note/controller count and apply.
All note onsets/lengths, every MIDI event timestamp, fades and the region duration
scale together relative to its existing start. Sustain, pitch bend, expression,
program changes and pressure retain their relative timing and original values.
Timeline start, source offset, pitches, channels, velocities, project tempo,
track/master automation and neighboring regions stay unchanged. Expansion can
overlap another region; this is not ripple editing. Instrument envelope times and
effect delays remain in seconds. Undo restores the entire original region.

Shared region.timeScale accepts only factor 0.0625..16 and a MIDI-region target.
It validates region/note/event limits before committing the atomic batch. Fades
are bounded against tiny floating-point rounding at the new region edge. Empty
MIDI regions can also be resized. Audio/video regions reject this operation; the
existing notes.timeScale remains available for notes-only selected-phrase edits.
The agent prompt explains which command includes controller data.

285 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover event types/channels/values, notes,
fades, unchanged neighboring regions and automation, invalid factors/limits,
non-MIDI targets, undo/redo and MIDI roundtrip. Browser checks verify inspector
presets/custom lengths, validation, persistence, and a real synth render proving
that sustain-pedal timing stretches with the notes. The inspector was visually
inspected. Audio stretching, graphical time handles, tempo maps and broader DAW
parity remain ongoing; live model access is still unconfigured locally.

Reference: Apple's MIDI region time-stretch workflow:
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/logicpro/lgcpf7c0ebee/10.7/mac/11.0


### Optional integer WAV dither

Export settings now offer None (default) or Triangular (TPDF) dither for 16- and
24-bit PCM. Mix, stem, cycle-range and selected-region bounces share this setting.
The setting remains local to the current workspace instance; it does not change
the project, playback, mix analysis or recording dither defaults. Selecting
32-bit float disables the control and skips dither, while retaining the integer
preference for switching back. No noise shaping or automatic normalization is
performed. Prefer float for intermediate mixes when preserving headroom matters.

The encoder adds the difference of two independent uniform random values in
integer LSB units before rounding, then clamps to signed PCM limits. Integer
encoding now uses uniform 2^(bits-1) scaling on both sides of zero (previously
positive samples used one less), avoiding a polarity-dependent quantizer step.
This correction also applies to non-dithered recordings; existing recordings
are unchanged. Independent samples/channels receive independent noise, including
silent sections. Repeated dithered exports are intentionally not bit-identical.

Validation: all 287 tests and the production build pass. The export settings
were visually inspected. Unit checks cover sub-LSB signal mean, noise variance, channel
independence, clipping, headers and float bypass. Browser checks inspect actual
16/24-bit downloads and confirm float exports ignore dither; the existing stem
routing, master bypass and mix reconstruction checks remain in the same script.
The browser script spaces its many downloads to avoid rapid-download throttling.

Reference: Apple's PCM bounce controls include dither for integer bit-depth
reduction. This implementation uses plain TPDF, not Apple's proprietary options:
https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/logicpro/lgcpb7e35135/10.7/mac/11.0


### Chromatic and scale-step MIDI transposition

The piano roll now has a Transpose notes panel instead of the fixed +1-semitone
button. Choose all notes or the current selection, enter a signed semitone or
scale-step shift, preview the affected count, then apply. Octave presets set
±12 semitones or one complete scale cycle (7 degrees in major/minor, 5 in
pentatonic, 12 in chromatic). They set the shift and do not immediately edit.
The controls validate before applying and disable empty, fractional, no-op,
missing-selection and out-of-range edits. Octave actions stay grouped when the
form wraps. Manual edits persist normally and are one undo step.

The existing notes.transpose command retains {semitones} compatibility and now
accepts optional mode=chromatic plus noteId or comma-separated noteIds. Diatonic
mode instead requires {mode:'diatonic',steps,root,scale}; root is 0..11, scale uses
the existing scale names and steps is an integer -127..127. Each degree advances
to the next allowed pitch, crossing octave boundaries. All selected pitches
must already be in the chosen scale; use the separate Key & scale tool first
when intentional snapping is wanted. Invalid inputs or any result outside MIDI
0..127 reject the entire batch rather than clamp. Audio/video targets reject.
Timing, velocity, channel, note IDs, MIDI controller/pressure events and unrelated
notes remain unchanged. Drum-kit pitches also identify instruments; transposing
them changes the drum sounds. This edits note data, not a live transpose insert
or a non-destructive global transposition track. The agent prompt describes the
same shared command and selection semantics; live model access remains
unconfigured locally.

291 tests and production build pass. Unit coverage includes all supported scales
in all 12 keys, octave crossings, legacy/selected operation, metadata and event
preservation, invalid batch rollback, undo/redo and MIDI export roundtrip.
Browser checks verify visible controls and validation, selected/all scope,
persistence, undo/redo and real offline sine renders (C4 to D4 for one C-major
step). The panel was visually inspected and its octave buttons grouped after
checking the wrapped layout.

controls; the implementation above operates on selected stored notes:

### Join MIDI regions

The MIDI region inspector now has Join MIDI regions. Choose other regions on the
same track individually, or Select all; Clear empties that selection. The
selected region remains the target and retains its ID and name. The preview
shows the combined duration, note/event counts, and flags differing source
region settings and controller state. The resulting span includes gaps and
overlaps. Other chosen regions are removed in the same undoable operation.

Shared region.joinMidi targets the retained region and accepts regionIds as a
comma-separated list of distinct ADDITIONAL IDs (exclude the target). Notes and
events retain IDs, pitch/value/channel, duration and absolute timeline position;
only their region-relative starts change. Source regions sort by timeline start,
stably in existing track order for ties; merged events then sort stably by time.
Thus later-starting source regions win equal-time controller ties. Target gain,
mute and fade settings apply across the combined span; other source region
settings are not baked into note velocities. MIDI source offset is reset to zero.

Joining combines region-local controller streams into one stream per channel.
Sustain, expression, pan or pitch bend can therefore affect notes that used to
belong to another region. This is editable MIDI consolidation, not guaranteed
sound-identical rendering. The UI and agent prompt make both controller and
region-setting behavior explicit. Undo restores every source region and its
settings. Audio/video and cross-track joining remain outside this operation.
Limits (20,000 notes and 20,000 events, 86,400-second region length), missing IDs,
duplicates and wrong tracks reject the entire command batch before committing.

295 tests and production build pass. Unit checks cover target identity, note and
event timing/IDs, overlapping and tied events, metadata, limits/atomic rollback,
undo/redo and MIDI roundtrip. Browser checks cover individual/all/clear selection,
preview warnings, persistence and undo/redo. Real offline audio renders verify
unchanged playback for ordinary note-only joins and the expected expression
change when two formerly separate regions share controller state after joining.
The inspector layout was visually inspected. Live model access remains
unconfigured locally; the validated shared command is available to that harness.

### Sustain-aware MIDI splits

Fixed Split at playhead / region.split dropping notes whose MIDI key release was
before the cut while CC64 still held them. MIDI splits now share the trim/crop
helper: the right region contains a new note at its start for each still-held
voice, plus chased controller and pitch-bend state for its own channel. Notes
that already stopped, including a pedal release exactly at the cut, do not carry.
Ordinary crossing notes retain their remaining gate length. Events exactly at
the cut belong on the right; left-side IDs remain and right-side IDs are fresh.
Outer fades are retained within the respective region lengths, internal fades
are zero and MIDI source offsets become zero. Audio/video splitting is unchanged.

Very long carried holds cap their new MIDI gate at 3,600 seconds to respect the
individual-note limit; the retained pedal stream sustains them to the original
release. The same improvement applies to MIDI cropping. Splitting is still
rearticulation at the cut (new oscillator/sample/envelope), not seamless audio
continuity. Undo restores the unsplit performance; this limitation is also
explicit in the agent instructions.

299 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover channel-isolated sustain, release at
the cut, crossing and exact-start notes, chased pitch bend, fresh IDs, fade
boundaries, long holds, invalid batch rollback, undo/redo and MIDI export.
Browser checks exercise the actual Split at playhead button and render real
Web Audio: the held note continues after the cut, ends at the original release,
and seeking inside the right region also restores sustain correctly. Reload
persistence and undo/redo pass. No physical MIDI hardware or live model call was
used for these checks.


### Workspace keyboard controls

Experimental now includes a collapsible Keyboard shortcuts reference and an
Enable workspace shortcuts switch. The switch is account/device scoped in
local storage (guest has a separate key), survives reload and does not change
the project document or revision. If preference storage fails, its in-memory
value still works for the current visit. Native buttons remain keyboard usable
when workspace shortcuts are off.

Space toggles play/pause; Home stops and returns to zero. Cmd/Ctrl Z undoes and
Cmd/Ctrl Shift Z redoes; Ctrl Y is also accepted. With the arrangement or region
inspector active, S splits at the playhead, D duplicates the selected region,
and Delete/Backspace deletes it. Track selection alone does not enable deletion.
In the piano roll, D and Delete apply to selected notes through the existing
selection buttons. The last clicked/focused editor determines this scope even
when a repaint moves browser focus to the body. Clicking another area clears
editing scope. Existing controller/automation/note keyboard handlers retain
priority through defaultPrevented; common browser shortcuts such as Cmd/Ctrl T,
D, S, R and W are not reassigned.

The document listener ignores text/select/range/contenteditable fields (including
shadow event paths), composition, Alt/unsupported modifiers, open dialogs and
unrelated focused controls. Space on buttons or summaries remains native. It
suppresses held-key repeats, pauses during pointer gestures/recording/loading,
and detaches when leaving the workspace. Reopening installs one listener set.
Shortcuts call existing UI buttons so validation, undo, selection and error
handling match mouse actions. This does not add transport tools to the model
or a customizable key-map editor; those remain separate future work.

301 tests and build pass. Browser checks cover actual region/note duplication
and deletion, split, both undo/redo modifier families, live transport changes,
Space button activation, text/IME/modal guards, repeat suppression, disabled
preference persistence, busy and detached-root gating, navigation cleanup and
remount. The shortcut reference was visually inspected. Browser transport used
synthetic session audio, not physical recording devices.

### Agent transport tool

The agent harness now offers control_transport when the browser explicitly sends
allowTransport plus a validated current transport snapshot. Actions are play,
pause, stop and seek. position is required as either absolute seconds 0..86400
or null: seek requires a number, pause/stop require null, and play accepts either.
Play(null) resumes the current position and is idempotent during playback.
Play(number) starts at that position. Pause keeps the playhead; stop returns to
zero; seek pauses at the requested position. Cycle settings remain active, and
the browser reports the actual start if the cycle redirects playback. Linear
playback rejects starting at or beyond the arrangement end.

This strict tool is separate from edit_session and analyze_mix: at most one tool
call is accepted per model response, and the browser rejects mixed edits/actions.
Transport does not change the document, revision or undo stack. The resulting
conversation entry is a reply with the browser-generated transport report and no
edit deltas. Recording, exports, undo and combined edit-plus-play sequences are
not implemented by this tool. Existing analysis/edit verification still works.

The server checks transport session/revision and echoes its epoch; the browser
compares it before execution. Manual play/pause/stop/seek or project replacement
invalidates a delayed transport plan. Natural playback progress alone does not.
Region double-click seeking now also stops/repositions through the transport
invalidation path. Existing recording/busy guards apply. Cancellation races
against decode, AudioContext.resume and cycle rendering, observing late failures
while preventing late results from scheduling playback. A canceled startup may
leave the requested playhead position selected; the report states the actual
current transport. It does not silently undo a later manual transport action.

304 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover opt-in/strict schemas, mismatched
context, invalid/mixed tool calls and cancellation of delayed promises. Browser
checks use real Web Audio and mocked model responses to verify seek/play/pause/
stop, idempotency, actual-result reports, conversation, unchanged document/undo,
stale-response rejection after a manual seek, canceled delayed context startup,
arrangement bounds and cycle redirection. The existing analysis/normalization/
post-edit verification browser regression passes. Config-only preflight confirms
OPENAI_API_KEY and DAW_AGENT_MODEL remain absent locally, so live inference has
not been verified and no provider request was made by that preflight.

### Ordered agent edits followed by transport

edit_session now accepts optional afterEditTransport when the client enables
transport. It uses the same validated operation/position shape as
control_transport. This supports requests such as lowering a track and then
playing from a requested time, without another user turn. The model is instructed
to add follow-up playback only when explicitly requested. Clients without the
capability do not receive that parameter in their tool schema, and a returned
unsupported follow-up is rejected. Multiple separate tool calls in one response
remain invalid; an ordered edit batch plus one transport action is one plan.

The browser validates the follow-up before applying any commands, checks both
document and transport freshness, then applies the edit batch once. Requested
mix verification (and mandatory master gain verification) finishes before the
follow-up. Manual playhead changes during verification suppress follow-up
transport, even though analysis itself is valid for the unchanged document.
Manual document changes similarly prevent starting playback of a stale edit.
Transport executes through the same helper as standalone transport requests.

Applied edits remain undoable if verification or playback fails or is canceled.
The result clearly distinguishes an applied edit from an incomplete follow-up;
conversation records retain the actual post-edit snapshot rather than attributing
later manual changes to the agent. Playback adds no undo entry. Successful
reports append the actual browser transport result. This supersedes the previous
requirement for separate edit and playback turns; arbitrary multi-step tool
loops, recording/export actions and live provider verification remain ongoing.

305 tests and build pass. Unit checks cover capability-gated schema exposure,
follow-up validation and command validation. Browser checks use mocked model
replies with real Web Audio to verify edit/analysis/play ordering, one-step undo,
invalid follow-ups rejected before editing, stale transport plans, verification
failure, manual seek during verification, canceled playback startup preserving
the edit, actual conversation attribution, and edit-then-seek. Existing
standalone transport and analysis regressions also run. Local model credentials
remain unconfigured; these are harness/execution checks, not live inference.

### Agent audio export

Ask the agent to bounce a mix, stems, a selected region, or a time range. Exports
use the same engine and settings as the manual controls. The agent may explicitly
choose sample rate, WAV depth, dither, master processing and stem grouping without
changing your saved project or current export preferences. Stems download as a
ZIP of aligned WAVs. The maximum render duration is ten minutes.

The request captures the current selection, cycle range and export settings.
Changing the project before completion invalidates the download. Cancel request
prevents a late render from downloading. Export stops playback and creates no
undo step. The completion report means the browser started the download; browser
download permissions still apply. An explicit edit-then-export request can use afterEditExport in one edit plan.
The app validates the resulting export before applying the edit, completes any
requested mix verification, then downloads. A failed verification or canceled
export leaves the edit available to undo and reports the incomplete follow-up.
Only one follow-up action is supported: export or transport. Model-tool tests
are mocked until live provider configuration is set.

For combined edits and export, inherited export preferences and region selection
come from the submitted request, while an inherited cycle range comes from the
edited project. Deleting the selected region and asking to export that region
rejects the entire plan before changes apply. Explicitly targeting another
existing or newly created region is supported. Exporting a mix after deleting a
region is valid. Follow-up exports do not add a second undo entry.

### Ask the agent to undo or redo

“Undo the last edit,” “Undo the last two edits,” and “Redo once” use the same
history as the toolbar. A command batch counts as one edit, and manual edits count
too. The entire request is rejected if there are not enough available steps.
Playback stops when history changes; recording must finish first.

This is chronological undo/redo, not selective removal of an older edit. History
resets on reload, and making a new edit clears redo. An agent request that becomes
stale after a manual edit is discarded rather than undoing that newer work.

### Crescendo and decrescendo

Open **Velocity ramp** in the piano roll. Choose all or selected notes, set start
and end velocity (0–127), and preview the result before applying. Reverse ramp
swaps the endpoints. Linear, ease-in and ease-out curves are available. The ramp
can span the first and last chosen note onset or the entire region. Chord notes
at the same start receive the same velocity; a single chosen onset uses the start
value. Apply is one undoable edit. For a swell during a held note, use expression
or volume automation instead. The agent can perform the same operation through
notes.velocityRamp with normalized endpoint values (0–1).

### Separate a MIDI pattern into tracks

Select a MIDI region, then open **Separate MIDI into tracks** in the inspector.
Choose note pitch for individual drum sounds or MIDI channel for separate parts.
The preview lists the new tracks. Each gets independent instrument/mix settings
copied from the source; notes keep their original timing. The source region stays
muted so it does not double playback. Undo restores the original arrangement.

Controllers needed by each part are copied too. Channel separation includes
channels containing only MIDI events. Routing and effects are copied, so nonlinear
track effects can change how the separated parts sound together. This separates
MIDI events; it cannot isolate instruments from a mixed audio recording.

### Shape a sampler sound

The sampler's **Sample filter** controls offer low-pass (soften highs) and
high-pass (remove lows), cutoff, resonance and keyboard tracking. Click **Use
sampler** to apply; Undo restores the previous settings. Off keeps the original
sound. At 100% keyboard tracking, cutoff doubles for each octave above the root
note. At 0%, every note uses the same cutoff. Pitch bend does not move cutoff.

Filtering is per voice before the volume envelope, and applies to playback,
live MIDI monitoring and bounced audio. These are static filter settings;
filter envelopes and automated modulation are not implemented yet.

### Tune a sample without editing the notes

The sampler has **Tune** (−48 to +48 semitones) and **Fine tune** (−100 to +100
cents) controls. A hundred cents equals one semitone. They apply across the
keyboard, including playback, exports, looping and live MIDI monitoring. Pitch
bend adds to this tuning. Use sampler applies the settings as one undoable edit.

Tuning changes playback speed: higher pitches consume the source sooner unless
it loops. MIDI notes, source audio, envelope times and filter key tracking stay
unchanged. This is not time stretching. Fractional tuning may restart a seek at
a whole source sample frame rather than the exact fractional phase.
